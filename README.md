Touch Of Modern iOS Challenge

**NOTES**

-Did not include iOS SDK
-The final page of the tutorial would ideally have clickable buttons for each of the 'social' methods, allowing new users the
 ability to start inviting users from the start of their shopping experience.
 -Avoided creating visuals for asynchronous progress
